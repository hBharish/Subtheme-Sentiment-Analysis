# Subtheme-Sentiment-Analysis
This repo contains the Google Colab code for Review Subtheme Sentiment Analysis using BERT.
This came about as an idea to treat the subtheme sentiments as labels and simply fine-tune a pretrained BERT model to give the required results for the project.
Initial data cleaning showed labels that did not contain the positive or negative sentiment so they were simply removed. 
After cleaning and proper labelling the data was then used to fine-tune a pretrained BERT model.
